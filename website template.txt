Section one: My Undergraduate at UofT

Header: I am studying at UofT in a program called, Technology Coding Society

Subheader: What am I learning?
In the Technology, Coding & Society (TCS) program, I'm learning to think critically and creatively at the intersection of design, code, and people. The program bridges front-end development, UX design, and digital ethics, giving me a strong foundation in both the technical skills and the human-centered thinking essential for meaningful digital experiences.
I’m developing:
UX design thinking – understanding how users interact with interfaces, and designing with empathy.
Front-end coding – building real apps with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
Prototyping & evaluation – iterating on designs with feedback and usability testing.
Social insight – learning how digital platforms shape (and are shaped by) culture, identity, and ethics.
Whether I’m sketching wireframes or coding interactions, I’m always learning how to create experiences that are intuitive, inclusive, and impactful.

Subheader: Course Synopsis

Here are a few standout courses shaping my approach to UX and front-end development:

Box one: CCT208 – Communications Research Methods Introduces research design and analysis—essential for UX research, user testing, and data-driven design decisions.

Box two: CCT285 – Immersive Environment Design Explores how to design interactive 3D and immersive spaces, bridging creativity, usability, and spatial thinking.

Box three: CCT211 – Fundamentals of UI Programming Covers essential programming skills for front-end development, with hands-on experience in building interactive user interfaces.
